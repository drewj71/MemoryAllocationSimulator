# MemoryAllocationSimulator
Memory Block Allocation Simulation from Operating Systems

Understanding the concept of RAM by allocating blocks of memory.

The program will run based on user input and will allocate memory into blocks and simulate storing them in ram.

It uses four allocation algorithms to allocate the memory blocks so that analysis can be done to see which allocation algorithm works best in which situation.
